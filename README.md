Welcome to my Deep Learning assignment repository. This repository contains implementation and documentation of foundational deep learning concepts as part of my academic curriculum.

üìÇ Contents
This repository includes the following assignments:

Logistic Regression

Implementation of binary classification using logistic regression.
Includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
Gradient Descent

Demonstrates various gradient descent techniques (Batch, Stochastic, Mini-batch).
Visualizations included to show convergence.
Loss and Cost Functions

Exploration of different loss and cost functions used in machine learning.
Comparison and use-cases explained with examples.
Regularization (L1 and L2)

Implementations of L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization.
Shows how regularization helps in avoiding overfitting.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

Basic CNN model built for image classification tasks.
Layers include convolution, pooling, and dense layers.
üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Python
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib / Seaborn
TensorFlow / Keras (for CNN)
